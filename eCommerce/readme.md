# Ecommerce Project

## Frameworks and Language Used

- Framework: Springboot
- Language: Java
- SQL DB

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following packages, each containing relevant classes:

- **Model Package**: Contains data models for various entities.
  - `UserModel`: Represents user-related data.
  - `ProductModel`: Represents product-related data.
  - `OrderModel`: Represents order-related data.
  - `AddressModel`: Represents address-related data.

- **Controller Package**: Contains controllers responsible for handling incoming requests.
  - `UserController`: Manages user-related requests.
  - `ProductController`: Manages product-related requests.
  - `OrderController`: Manages order-related requests.
  - `AddressController`: Manages address-related requests.

- **Repository Package**: Contains repositories for interacting with the database.
  - `UserRepository`: Handles user data in the database.
  - `ProductRepository`: Handles product data in the database.
  - `OrderRepository`: Handles order data in the database.
  - `AddressRepository`: Handles address data in the database.

- **Service Package**: Contains services that encapsulate business logic.
  - `UserService`: Implements user-related business logic.
  - `ProductService`: Implements product-related business logic.
  - `OrderService`: Implements order-related business logic.
  - `AddressService`: Implements address-related business logic.

## Data Flow

The data flow within the project follows these general steps:

1. Incoming requests are routed to the appropriate controller based on the endpoint.
2. The controller processes the request and delegates business logic to the corresponding service.
3. The service interacts with the repository to perform database operations, if required.
4. Data is returned to the controller, which responds to the client with the appropriate HTTP status and data.

## Data Structures Used

- The project utilizes various data structures such as arrays, objects, and database tables to manage and store data efficiently.
- Specific data structures for data storage and manipulation may vary based on the programming language and database used.

## Project Summary

The "Ecommerce Project" is a web-based application built using springboot and Java. It offers a robust backend API for managing users, products, orders, and addresses. The project follows a structured organization with distinct packages for models, controllers, repositories, and services to ensure maintainability and scalability.

The data flow in the project is well-defined, with controllers handling incoming requests and services implementing the underlying business logic. Data is stored and managed using various data structures and is persisted in an SQL database.

This project aims to provide a solid foundation for building an ecommerce platform with features for creating users, managing products, placing orders, and more.
